# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore virtual environment
security_venv/

# Ignore checkpoints
*/.ipynb_checkpoints

# Ignore figure folder
profiles/figuras_nuse/
